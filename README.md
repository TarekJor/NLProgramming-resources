# NLProgramming-resources
A curated list of Natural Language Programming resources (is not Natural Language Processing per se)


## Functional programming with languages and semantics

Haskell
Ocaml
F#
C#
Wolfram Language from WolframAlpha 
Scala 
Erlang

## Prototyping and semantics

objects
encaptulation
methods
functions
invoke
context
definitions
config
parameters


## keys (research)

pseudoCode prototyping with abstraction and semantic models
microSyntax via voice commands
support syntax sugar as identation and clean code
algorythms design in pseudo code and assistance via AI inference to formal code implementation
natural language vs code implementation (assisted revision and check)
Implement a Jarvis-like assistant who understand cli scripting invokation (Bash, Powershell) with reasoning on semantic.level, context, syntax, inference, induction
AI powered compiler and code management
Package integration of main package management systems from BSD, Linux distros, Windows Chocolatey, Brew and programming languages or apps repositories like SublimeText (Package Control) Python (Pypi) Perl (CPAN), PHP (PEAR), Maven (Java), Arch Linux (AUR) repo, etc
